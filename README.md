# RobLog

A React-Redux based blog that I created for CS52 at Dartmouth 16X. I also used
react router to routing different parts of the page from different urls. The
blog calls at REST-ful CRUD api to make all of its queries. There is no styling

It was difficult to understand how redux connects things at first, but once
that became apparent, the process flowed more easily.
