# RobLog

A React-Redux based blog that I created for CS52 at Dartmouth 16X. I also used
react router to routing different parts of the page from different urls. The
blog calls at REST-ful CRUD api to make all of its queries. There is no styling.
This branch features authentication integration with a Salt+hashed password. It
also restricts many functions to be for logged in users only.

Still having a hard time figuring out redux connections, but it's becoming a
little more clear with time.
